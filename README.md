RITCapstone
===========

All things related to my Capstone Research Project to complete my Master's Degree in Communications and Public Policy at Rochester Institute of Technology.

The "Final" version you want to look at is "capstone-report-remy.pdf" however, you'll have to download it as it is too large for github to display in the raw :)

Enjoy!
